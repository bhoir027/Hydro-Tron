# Serverless Application - Hydro-Tron
In this mini project I have implemented a simple serverless application using S3, API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, SNS & SES.

The architecture consists of 6 stages :-

STAGE 1 --> Configure Simple Email service <br />
STAGE 2 --> Add a email lambda function to use SES to send emails for the serverless application <br />
STAGE 3 --> Implement and configure the state machine, the core of the application <br />
STAGE 4 --> Implement the API Gateway, API and supporting lambda function <br />
STAGE 5 --> Implement the static frontend application and test functionality <br />
STAGE 6 --> Cleanup the account
